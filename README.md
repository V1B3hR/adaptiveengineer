 \_adaptiveengineer_/ module defines an advanced, adaptive agent called AliveLoopNode for multi-agent simulations. 
 It models a socially-aware, energetically-limited node capable of interacting with others through rich, 
 production-quality signal mechanisms (including deduplication, DLQ, partitioned queues, etc.). 
 Each node manages complex internal states—energy, memory with privacy controls, emotional health (anxiety, joy, grief, curiosity, resilience, etc.)
 and evaluates trust, social learning, and cooperative behaviors. It handles proactive interventions (anxiety/grief/hope/calm), 
 detects and responds to energy attacks, and adapts its role dynamically based on environmental and emotional factors. 
 The node’s behavior includes sharing valuable knowledge, managing distributed trust via consensus, coping with byzantine adversaries, 
 and supporting emotional wellbeing of peers. The design is modular, deeply configurable, and emphasizes robustness, ethics, 
 and social dynamics, making it suitable for research or engineering adaptive, fault-tolerant, social AI collectives.
